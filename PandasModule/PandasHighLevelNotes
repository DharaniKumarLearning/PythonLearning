pandas is a data analysis library that allows us to easily read and work with different types of data.
We can use this library to analyse csv files, Excel files etc.,
It allows to easily read in and analyse data and also has great performance since it is built on top of NumPy

import pandas as pd -- to import the pandas package
df = pd.read_csv("survey_results_public.csv") -- To read a csv file and create a dataframe

Dataframe is the backbone of the pandas
Dataframe is basically rows and columns

df.shape -- To know the number of rows and columns present in the Dataframe in the tuple form
df.info() -- Along with the number of rows and columns it displays the datatype of all the columns present in the dataframe
