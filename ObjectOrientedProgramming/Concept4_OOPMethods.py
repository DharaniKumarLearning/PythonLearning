1. instance methods:
    Instance methods are object related methods
    Inside method body if we are accessing instance variables then that method talks about a particular
        object such type of methods are called instance methods.
    Instance methods should be called by using object reference
    Getter and Setter methods are also instance methods which are helpful in setting and getting value of instance variables
    Normally we should not access variables outside class instead we should use getter and setter methods to set and get instance variables
    Getter methods are also known as accessor methods
    Setter methods are also known as mutator methods

2. Class methods:
    These methods are very rarely used
    Inside method body if we are using only static variables then that method is called class method

3. Static methods:
    If we are not using any instance or static variables then that methods are called static methods
    These methods just take a set of parameters and perform some business logic on it
    These methods are also known as general utility methods
